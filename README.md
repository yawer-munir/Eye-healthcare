The focus is on Eye blinks - logic: for each minute, if eye blinks are less than 45, then remind users to take a break, wash eyes, drink water, relax
If eye blink counter per minute reaches more than 55, then a visit to doctor should be recommended
If eye blink counter per minute is less than 35, then it's an issue of dryness and mix of other eye symptoms, eye drops should be recommended with visit to doctor
This eye blinking is also useful for monitoring moods, health, water drinking habits, frustration, rage, health issues and much more
If we implement logic accordingly for this, we can achieve a lot
